# Project for Fishbowl Hackathon
When paying at the register, the customer is offered the opportunity to take a survey for an immediate discount. This survey is distributed through the use of an NFC/QR code, which will direct the user to a website. This website is made to gather customer data through the survey and to enter customers into a loyalty program.
